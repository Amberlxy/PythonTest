Today I went to the library to read books, return books and borrow books.I go to the library every Saturday. The Huzhou Library is located Renhuang the mountain developed area.And I always go there to read books, return books and borrow books.Today I borrrowed Math Historical novel,Mysterious maths,Comprehensive Handbook of Mathematics Symbols and Extracurricular interest physics.What? They are all about math and science. Yes, that is right! Because I like them.And I like science better although I borrowed more math books this time.Because I think Math is the solution science question important tool, and math is also thought gymnastics.And our math teacher Mr.zhou said Math is the natural science’s foundation.I think that is right.Because if I want to read some books about science for University student, I have to know higher math’s knowledge.So I need read many math books. So it gives me a great chance to make me be better at science and math.Maybe I can be a sciencetist.I hope I can get more science by read books from library.Then I need make science experiment in the university.I hope I can do them better
