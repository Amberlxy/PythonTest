Now the 80's are more and more difficult to live by themselves ,especially those who graduated from college and live in city .My college classmates always complain me that they get salary just for house rent ,food and different cost .They have no savings. Even some engaged in building construction crew want to change the job. They can't tolerate the job which have no rest. I sympathize with them. Lots of students after graduation go back home to work. It seems like a good choice, but was hard to find a right job which he learn from college.
As a curtain wall designer, I am not better than my classmates. I have the same problems with them. To relieve the economic pressure, I live with my parents. I want to accumulate wealth and take use of it in right time. Since having this idea , I give myself three requirements. Firstly, Learn more skills in order to improve myself in the job. It will be the most effective way to increase income. Secondly, another way to accumulate wealth is reducing expenditure. I realise that many expenditure and wasting can be avoided in my life. Including working by bike instead of bus, making full use of water and electric resources, and so on. Finally, it is an investment in my brain. I will take advantage of my spare time to learn knowledge and English language. Maybe it will play an important role in my life.
In one word, you should catch your time. As the proverb goes: time is money. It's simple but meaningful.
